# BachelorThesis

In this repository you can find my Bachelor thesis:" Distribution for products in asymmetric $e^+ e^- $ collider: an example in B and L violating $\tau$ decay", codes and supplementary explanations files (thesis.pdf, slides.pdf) are also available.

The aim of this thesis is to provide a computational analysis of the distributions for the momenta of particles, produced up to $n$-th order two body decays, and flight distances requirement in asymmetric collider. In particular, it is analyzed the case of $e^+ e^- $ in $\tau^+ \tau^- $ with one $\tau$ decaying in $\Lambda^0 + \pi$, as in arXiv:hep-ex/0607040v1, in order to reproduce the Monte Carlo simulations of Fig.(1) in the reference.
The study is helpful in understanding the detector configuration. Known the lifetime of each particle it is possible to compute the distribution of flight length of each particle in the k-th step of the process, giving information not only at which distance from the collision center it is most probably to find that particular vertex but also what kind of particles are required to be analyzed for a particular collision given the dimension of the detector. Then simulating a large number of events it is indeed possible to determine the energy distribution and the 3-momenta module distribution in the laboratory frame of any particle involved so it is possible, once chosen the size of the detector, to choose which kind of identification method is better to be implemented in.
